# AmpHelper
AmpHelper is both a library and command line tool for unpacking/repacking Amplitude (2016) ark files as well as managing custom songs.

Included are also a couple tweaks that modify the game files in various ways.

The aim is to provide the same functionality as [Adam Clixby's Modulate](https://github.com/AdamClixby/Modulate/), but with a C# codebase.
